Work together with your friends in LAN. Very usefull in COVID-19 worldwide situaton (of course your collages must be in the same Network as you). Free to use.

IMPORTANT - PROJECTS IS FINISHED, BUT STILL SOME FEATURES COULD NOT WORK - FOR EXAMPLE TEXT BUTTON FOR ADMIN IS NOT DOING ANYTHING FOR NOW, I HAVE TO ADD IT IN NEXT VERSIONS
PS: I am still learning of JAVA so some algortithms or classes I copied from other developers but for my use I made some changes and improved them for this project.
