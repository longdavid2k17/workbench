# How text chat and voice chat works

![Chat view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/longdavid2k17/workbench/master/screens_Workbench/3_chat.PNG)
To use text chat, after creating or joining session, you have to write nickname, which will be used for user reconization. Then you will
see next sended messages in session. In administrator panel there will be information about connected users
For voice chat all you need is connected microphone to your computer. Without micro, you will be just hearing the conversation of other users.
